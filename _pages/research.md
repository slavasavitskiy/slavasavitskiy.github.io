**Climatic Roots of Loss Aversion** with [Oded Galor](https://www.odedgalor.com/) (2020)

This research explores the origins of loss aversion and the variation in its prevalence across regions, nations and ethnic group. It advances the hypothesis and establishes empirically that the evolution of loss aversion in the course of human history can be traced to the adaptation of humans to the asymmetric effects of climatic shocks on reproductive success during the epoch in which subsistence consumption was a binding constraint. Exploiting regional variations in the vulnerability to climatic shocks and their exogenous changes in the course of the Columbian Exchange, the research suggests that  consistent with the predictions of the theory, individuals and ethnic groups that are originated in regions marked by a greater climatic volatility have a higher predisposition toward loss-neutrality, while descendants of regions in which climatic conditions tended to be spatially correlated, and thus shocks were aggregate in nature, are characterized by a greater intensity of loss aversion.

**Environmental Roots of Labor-Leisure Preference** with [Oded Galor](https://www.odedgalor.com/) (2020)

This research explores the origins of labour-leisure preference and the variation in its prevalence across regions and nations. It advances the hypothesis and establishes empirically that the evolution of predisposition towards labour and leisure in the course of human history can be traced to the adaptation of humans to the modes of production, characterized by the different return to effort in the long-run. Exploiting regional variations in the potential suitability for hunting and agriculture and their exogenous changes in the course of the Columbian Exchange, the research establishes that  consistent with the predictions of the theory, individuals that are originated in regions marked by greater suitability for hunting have higher predisposition towards leisure, while descendants of regions in which agriculture was more productive are characterized by greater predisposition towards labour.
